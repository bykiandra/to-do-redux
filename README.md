# To Do Redux

A to do app built using React and Redux.

Originally the app had categories for the to do items, but the code was getting messy, so I've removed them for now. I'll add them back in when I figure out a better way to do it.

#### Still to do:

- [x] Edit to do items
- [x] Remove to do items.

##### Maybe in the future:

- [ ] Add categories back in.
- [ ] Have completed to do items automatically move to bottom of list.
- [ ] Ability to add notes to to do items.
